# Personal blog

This is my personal blog made in Nextjs and using markdown

## Scripts

This creates a server on localhost:3000 and rebuild it when you make changes.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This creates a production-ready version of the app and can be deployed to the web.

```bash
npm run build
```
