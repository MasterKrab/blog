# Personal blog

This is my personal blog page where I write articles from time to time about various web technologies. The articles are written in markdown using mdx, the frontend and backend are made in NextJs because of the provided optimizations and Server Side Rendering, the search function is made using Algolia because of its ease of use and efficiency, the commenting system was made using Giscus because of the possibility to use github discussions to host comments.

## Prerequisites

Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Scripts

This creates a server on localhost:3000 and rebuild it when you make changes.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This creates a production-ready version of the app and can be deployed to the web.

```bash
npm run build
```
